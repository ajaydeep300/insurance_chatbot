    "        - car_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for each car.\n",
    "        - make (VARCHAR): Manufacturer of the car (e.g., 'Tesla').\n",
    "        - model (VARCHAR): Model of the car (e.g., 'Model S').\n",
    "        - year (INT): Year the car was manufactured.\n",

    "        - part_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for each car part.\n",
    "        - car_id (INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES cars(car_id)): Foreign key linking the part to the specific car.\n",
    "        - part_name (VARCHAR): Name of the car part (e.g., 'Front Bumper', 'Battery Pack').\n",
    "        - part_type (VARCHAR): Type of car part (e.g., 'body', 'mechanical', 'electrical').\n",
    "        - repair_cost (DECIMAL): Cost to repair the car part.\n",
    "        - replacement_cost (DECIMAL): Cost to replace the car part.\n",
    "        - description (TEXT): Additional details about the part (e.g., 'The front bumper is designed to absorb impacts.').\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The 'cars' table stores information about each car, while the 'car_parts' table stores information about individual car parts, including their repair and replacement costs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Instructions for SQL Generation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - You are **only** required to generate a single SQL query based on the user's request. **Do not generate any explanations, comments, or additional text.**\n",
    "    - The query must be properly formatted and executable in a MySQL database.\n",
    "    - Use the following rules when generating the query:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### Repair Cost Estimate (Specific Instructions):\n",
    "    1. If an **estimated repair cost** is requested: \n",
    "       - Use the **repair_cost** from the `car_parts` table if the damage percentage to the part is **50% or less**.\n",
    "       - Use the **replacement_cost** if the damage to the part is **greater than 50%**.\n",
    "       - To access the information on car part damage percentage, reference : {res}\n",
    "    2. If the user asks for a **minimum estimate** for repair, return the **minimum repair cost** for all car parts.\n",
    "    3. Finally, **sum** the selected repair and replacement costs to provide a total estimate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### General Questions:\n",
    "    - For all other general questions, simply return an SQL query that addresses the user's request based on the provided schema and previous chat responses focus, on the report generated and use only the values sepcified in the report.\n",
    "    Note that you can only answer in SQL Queries\n",
